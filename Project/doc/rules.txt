In order to be admitted to the oral exam, the assignments (source files 
and verification/simulation outputs generated by Spin and NuSMV) must be
completed correctly. 
If you submit an assignment that is not correct, I will contact you and ask
you to fix the errors and resubmit. 
It is important to remember that A CORRECT VERSION OF THE ASSIGNMENTS MUST BE
SUBMITTED AT LEAST ONE WEEK BEFORE THE ORAL EXAM, so you are encouraged to
submit earlier if you are not sure that your solution is 100% satisfactory.

During the exam, questions may be asked in order to verify the authenticity of
your submission.

The problems must be solved on your own. You may however discuss verbally or
via email the general nature of the problems to be solved with your classmates
or with me, but you must implement the solutions by yourself. You will be
asked questions about the project, in order to verify that you did your own
work.

The assignments must be sent by email to silvia.tomasi@disi.unitn.it. The email
message must have the following subject: FM 2011 assignments

Good luck!

Silvia
