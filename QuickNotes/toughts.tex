    \section{About expressiveness of \CTL\ and \LTL}

        $\LTL$ is about paths, while $\CTL$ is about single steps in which
        I can chose, at any time, the direction I'm gonna take on the next
        step. In the $\LTL$ approach, if I've chosen a path I cannot
        change my mind.

        \subsection{Express \CTL\ with \LTL}

            \begin{itemize}

            \item   An expression using existential quantifiers in
                    \CTL\ requires, in order to be satisfied, to be true
                    for a subset of the available paths.

            \item   All \LTL\ formulae implicitly require an universal
                    quantification among all possible paths, thus \LTL\
                    formula, in order to be true, must be satisfied by all
                    possible paths.

            \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Express \LTL\ with \CTL}

            \begin{itemize}

            \item   A typical check we want to achieve is about fairness
                    properties:
                    \[
                    \left(
                        \IterAnd{f \in \Set{ f_1 \cdots f_n }}{}{\G\F f}
                    \right)
                    \imply \psi
                    \]

            \item   $\G{\F{\phi}}$ in \CTL\ becomes $\AG{\AF{\phi}}$;

            \item   Since $a \imply b$ is defined as $\neg a \lOr b$ we
                    have a negation of $\G{\F{\phi}}$ terms;

            \item   $\neg \G{\F{\phi}} = \F{\G{\neg \phi}}$, namely
                    \Intuit{in each path, after a certain point, $\phi$
                    will never hold again};

            \item   $\neg \AG{\AF{\phi}} = \EF{\EG{\neg \phi}}$, namely
                    \Intuit{there's a path among many in which $\phi$ is
                    not holding} (much less restrictive than $\F{\G{\neg
                    \phi}}$, which requires $\neg \phi$ to hold in all
                    paths).

            \end{itemize}
