\subsection{Fair conditions}

\[
    F = \Set{ F_1, F_2, \cdots F_n } \subseteq 2^S
\]

\begin{itemize}

\item   Fair path $\pi$: $\forall F_i \in F$, $\pi$ visits infinitely
        often at least one state $S \in F_i$;

\item   Fair states: originating a fair path;

\item   $M_f$ is a fair model, a Kripke Model restricted to the fair
        paths.

\item   Syntactic sugar:
        \[ M_f,s \Entails \E{\phi}
           \:\Leftrightarrow\: M,s \Entails \Ef{\phi}{f} \]
        \[ M_f,s \Entails \A{\phi}
           \:\Leftrightarrow\: M,s \Entails \Af{\phi}{f} \]

\item   All fair states are encoded by a single set: $\Fair =
        \Ef{\G{\True}}{f}$:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item   $\Ef{\X{\phi}}{f}$ obtained as $\E{\X{(\varphi \lAnd \Fair)}}$;
    \item   $\Ef{\U{\varphi}{\psi}}{f}$ obtained as $\E{\U{\varphi}{(\psi
            \lAnd \Fair)}}$
    \item   In order to compute $\Fair$ we need a function to compute
            $\Ef{\G{\varphi}}{f}$
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-symbolic: SCC}

    Computation of $\Ef{\G{\varphi}}{f}$ with sets:

    \begin{itemize}

    \item   Restrict states of a Kripke Model $M$ to
            $\Denot{\varphi}$, obtaining $M^\prime$;

    \item   Compute the union of all \emph{fair} strongly connected
            components of $M^\prime$: \[C = \IterUnion{i = 1}{n}{C_i}\]

    \item   $\Denot{\Ef{\G{\varphi}}{f}} =
             \Denot{\E{\U{\varphi}{\mathcal{C}}}}$
            where $\Denot{\mathcal{C}} = C$

        \begin{itemize}
        \item   If we are in $C$ then we are in $C_i$ for some $i \in 
                \Set{ 1 \cdot n }$;
        \item   Since $C_i$ is part of $M^\prime$, $\varphi$ always holds
                in states of $C_i$; and since $C_i$ is a \emph{fair} SCC
                we have also fairness
        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Symbolic: \emph{Emerson Lei}}

    We cannot easily do a symbolic representation of SCC, thus we directly
    encode fairness conditions inside the fixed-point based symbolic
    representation of the formula $\Ef{\G{\varphi}}{f}$.

    \[
    \SymbDenot{\Ef{\G{\varphi}}{f}} =
        \SymbDenot{\varphi} \IterIntersect{f \in F}{}{
        }
    \]
