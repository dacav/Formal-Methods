\begin{itemize}

	\item	Synchronous and Asynchronous composition:

		\begin{itemize}
		\item	Shared variables give limitations about how the transition
                can be followed: only \emph{synchronous} will work
                provided that both machines change the shared variable in
                the same instant with the same value.
		\end{itemize}

    \item   Properties:

        \begin{enumerate}
        \item   Safety (\Intuit{never bad}): refuted by finite behavior
                (counter-example);
        \item   Liveness (\Intuit{happens good}): refuted by infinite
                behavior (loop);
        \item   Fairness: (\Intuit{infinitely often good}): refuted by
                infinite behavior (loop);
        \end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}
